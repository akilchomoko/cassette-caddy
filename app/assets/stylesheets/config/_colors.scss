// Define variables for your color scheme

// TODO - How can we add and use more colour variables - I have added some below - but they don't seem to work

// For example:
$red: #FD1015;
$blue: #167FFB;
$yellow: #FFC65A;
$orange: #E67E22;
$green: #1EDD88;
$gray: #0E0000;
$light-gray: #F4F4F4; 
$purple: #8B65DA;
// $background: #1C1E30;
// $foreground: #222337;
